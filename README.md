AspNet Identity 2.0 Extensible Project Template
===============================================
This project expands upon the work done by the ASP.NET Identity Team in the Identity Samples project. The goal is to provide a basic project template wherein the core identity Model classes are easily extensible without messing about with the generic type arguments.

While extending the basic `ApplicationUser` class provided in the original Identity Samples project was always relatively straightforward, Extending the Role implementation required some significant work. 

In this project, you can simply add additional properties and/or methods to any of the Identity Model classes as defined in the IdentityModels.cs file. 

For more information, see:

* [ASP.NET Identity 2.0: Customizing Users and Roles](http://typecastexception.com/post/2014/06/22/ASPNET-Identity-20-Customizing-Users-and-Roles.aspx)

The code in this repo is for a project where the Identity models use string keys. If you prefer integer keys (and database PK fields) see this repo instead:

[AspNet Identity 2.0 Extensible Project Template (integer keys)](https://github.com/TypecastException/AspNet-Identity-2-With-Integer-Keys)

There is a lot of good information here about how things work under the hood with the generic types, even if you don;t plan to use the integer keys:
